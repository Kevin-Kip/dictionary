Contains all the words of the English language.
They exist in the form:
```
[
  {
    "word": "Word",
    "type": "(n.)",
    "description": "Talk; discourse; speech; language."
  },
  {
    "word": "Word",
    "type": "(n.)",
    "description": "Account; tidings; message; communication; information; -- used only in the singular."
  }
]
```
